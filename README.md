### ðŸ’¡ Main Idea: 

The central idea behind this music bot is to emulate a radio experience, where users across various Discord servers can simultaneously enjoy the same song at the same time. By limiting the bot's presence to a single music channel designated as the "master" channel, the bot will ensure synchronization across all connected servers. The master channel will act as a control center for playback, queue management, and song selection, maintaining a unified musical atmosphere throughout the connected community.

To achieve the radio-like experience, the bot will possess the capability to join multiple servers at the users' request. This feature allows the bot to broadcast the same song across all the connected servers.

In addition to its in-server functionality, the proposed bot will be integrated with a web interface. This web interface will serve as an external platform, displaying the current playing song and the upcoming queue to users accessing it.

To implement this music bot, certain technical aspects need to be addressed. These include robust queue management to maintain song synchronization, efficient handling of server connections, and the development of an intuitive web interface.
